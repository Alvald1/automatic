# Automatic - QR Code Scanner & Web Server Sync

## Overview
Automatic is an Android application that allows users to scan QR codes and barcodes and synchronize the data with a web server. The app provides fast and reliable scanning capabilities along with secure data transmission to backend services.

## Key Features

### QR Code & Barcode Scanning
- Fast and accurate scanning of all standard barcode formats
- Real-time scanning with visual feedback
- Support for difficult lighting conditions with flash control
- Camera switching capability for front/back cameras
- Animated scanning indicator for better user experience

### Web Server Synchronization
- Secure transmission of scanned data to backend servers
- Support for various API authentication methods
- Offline scanning with queue management for later synchronization
- Data validation before transmission

### User Experience
- Clean, modern interface designed for ease of use
- Fast app startup and scanning initiation
- Minimal permission requirements (camera only)
- Support for Android 8.0 and above

## Architecture

The application is built with a modular architecture:

- **app**: Main application module with core functionality and UI
- **scanner**: Dedicated module for QR/barcode scanning functionality
- **design**: Shared UI components, styles, and utilities

The app follows modern Android development practices:
- MVVM architecture
- Kotlin Coroutines for asynchronous operations
- CameraX for camera functionality
- ML Kit for barcode detection
- Lifecycle-aware components

## Setup & Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Configure the server endpoint in the application configuration
3. Build and install the application

### Configuration

Server connection settings can be configured in the application settings:
- API endpoint URL
- Authentication credentials
- Sync frequency
- Data retention policy

## Usage

### Scanning a QR Code

1. Launch the application
2. Point the camera at a QR code or barcode
3. The app will automatically detect and decode the content
4. Scanned data will be displayed on screen and queued for synchronization

### Manual Synchronization

If automatic synchronization is disabled:

1. Navigate to the scanned items list
2. Select items to synchronize or use "Sync All" option
3. View synchronization status and any error messages

## Technical Requirements
- Minimum SDK: 26 (Android 8.0)
- Target SDK: 35
- Compile SDK: 35
- Java Version: 11 (Scanner) / 17 (Design)
- Network connectivity for synchronization

## Permissions
- Camera: Required for scanning functionality
- Internet: Required for server synchronization
- Network State: For monitoring connectivity changes

## Future Enhancements
- Batch scanning mode for multiple codes
- Custom QR code generation
- Enhanced data analytics and reporting
- Integration with more third-party services
- Expanded offline capabilities
